### Sprint 2

 Our group was able to implement most features we planned for this sprint like, whenever a bag is bought, the number of
 bags left is decreased, and connecting the database to the main pages of the app. Even though those are ready, we were not able to create unit tests for testing them just yet, which was our main difficulty in this sprint.

- Information about Sales [STAFF]
- Access to Customer Support [STAFF]
- Access to Customer Support [USER]
