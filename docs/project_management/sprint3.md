### Sprint 3

## Sprint Review 
Some of the features we had planned in the first week did not make it into the final version of our project, although we still believe they hold value. Excluding that, we implemented all the other features, fixed some visual bugs, and completed the tests.

# What went well?
-We finished all the features in the backlog and tested them (most of them).
-The work rate improved compared to previous sprints, as we became more familiar with the tools and the environment.
-We effectively organized the README and the GitHub repository.

# What went less well?
- Due to having other projects, we couldn't fully focus on this one. As a result, we could have had more features and a better design.

# What did we learn?
- Now that we are more familiar with the tools used in this project, we can use them more efficiently, as there is always room to learn.

# What should we change?
- Improve our organization from the beginning.
- Testing the features proved to be a challenge again, as we faced difficulties in building the tests.
